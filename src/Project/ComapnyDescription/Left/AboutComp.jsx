      <p>
        A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet
        for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked,
        high-growth companies on their next big thing. After talking with
        hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we
        heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent
        clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding.
        A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world
        with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a
        contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly
        launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.
